According to the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office, 3rd District deputies tried to pull over a red Dodge Ram pickup truck near Ames Boulevard and the Westbank Expressway. Reason unknown. The driver, later identified as Reyes, refused to stop, leading deputies on a short pursuit that ended at Ames Boulevard and Salome Street, investigators said.

Detectives said Reyes fled of foot and ran on Salome Street and then turned south on Eiseman Avenue.

JPSO said when Reyes reached the 500 block of Eiseman Avenue, the sheriff's office said he tripped and fell to the ground.

One of the deputies caught up to Reyes and tried to put him in handcuffs when they say he turned and pointed a firearm at the deputy.

JPSO said the deputy then fired multiple times at the suspect, who was struck by the gunfire. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

According to the sheriff's office, Reyes had two firearms on him, which were recovered at the scene, as well as narcotics (June 23, 2020, Press conference, www.wdsu.com). Some reports say the unspecified drugs were found in a backpack, others say from Reye's truck.

Some are skeptical of this account, as there were no body cameras present to rule out that evidence was compromised after the shooting; and stun gun recording ended. Reyes’ relatives and friends, however, remain skeptical of law enforcement's explanation for the shooting. They said they believe Reyes was holding a cellphone when the deputy opened fire.

One of the two Deputies stun gun had a video camera that activated when the stun gun was engaged. It is reported that on the video, one officer yells ""move!"" while the other yells ""gun!"" and shots are fired. Video reportedly shows subject roll to side, clutching an object that looks like a gun. 

“The suspect actually tripped on the ground and fell down to the ground. As they approached, he came up with one gun. He was actually in possession of two fire arms at the period of time, pointed none of them at our deputies, when one of our deputies ended up firing several shots striking the individual who was later pronounced dead here on the scene,” said Sheriff Joe Lopinto the night it happened.

The Reyes family hasn’t seen that video and Lopinto said because it’s an active investigation none of the evidence is being released. Lopinto expects independent autopsies to line up with the evidence but said he’s not able to share everything with the family. 

An independent autopsy at the request of the family of Modesto Reyes shows the preliminary report from the Louisiana Forensic Center. According to that report, Reyes was shot twice in the back. 

Only having an independent autopsy report, the Reyes family feels they’re being kept in the dark, only getting information by what’s being reported in the news. 

A lawsuit has not been filed against the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office concerning this case, but attorneys do expect one. A demand letter has been issued for that video to be released as the family waits on the full autopsy report.

The Norfolk officer arrived and a confrontation arose between he and the victim, Kelvin White. The Norfolk officer stated that he identified himself ""as police"" before firing his gun, but no details have been released about what led to the officer to use his weapon. Witnesses report hearing one gunshot, a pause, then several additional gunshots. One witness approached the scene after the gunshots and observed the victim lying face down on the ground, handcuffed, with gunshot wounds. This witness also reported that he saw a pocketknife sticking out of victim's back pocket. The victim's family has stated that the victim was schizophrenic and that ""he is not a person who would harm anyone."" It is unclear why the Norfolk officer decided to respond to the incident himself, rather than call the Chesapeake police, whose jurisdiction the event occurred in. The officer's name has not been released. It's unclear if the investigation is still ongoing or not.

Norwalk Police said they were called to the AT&T store on Main Avenue around 4:30 p.m. The employees reported to police there was a person inside the store who engaged in an argument and had a knife at his side. Later identified as Soulemane.

According to police, the employees asked Soulemane to leave. While on his way out the store, police say the suspect tried stealing an iPhone 11 from someone. One of the employees then reportedly took the phone back from the suspect and he left the store.

Police said that the suspect then got into a white SUV, called in by a rideshare app and left.

While in the SUV, police said the suspect got into an argument with the driver over the driver's cellphone. The suspect reportedly slapped the driver, and the driver then pulled over. Police said both the driver and the suspect then got out of the SUV; the suspect then stole the vehicle and left.

A broadcast went out that described the SUV, and officers who spotted it then engaged in brief pursuit before being called off (www.fox61.com).

Connecticut State Police Troopers than pursued Soulemane into West Haven on I-95 north where he reportedly struck multiple troopers and pedestrian cars. He then drove onto the Exit 43 ramp, ending up under the bridge on Campbell Avenue.
State Police said that troopers approached the vehicle.

An altercation occurred at that time. Some shots were fired by a state trooper and Soulemane was struck by some gunfire, said Colonel Stavros Mellekas of the Connecticut State Police. The suspect was later pronounced dead.

Police said they found a knife in the car.

Two nearby troopers had body cameras on. There is video and dispatcher audio.

Officers involved with the shooting are on paid administrative leave while the investigation is ongoing. The New London State Attorney and the Central District Major Crimes Unit are investigating the incident (www.fox61.com).

The investigation has determined that only Trooper Brian North discharged his duty pistol. In accordance with Department policy, Trooper North has been placed on administrative leave. Other two police involved are: Troopers Joshua Jackson and Ross Dalling.

Soulemane, 19, was known to local police to be battliing with schizophrenia; he was tasered and shot. 

The family of Mubarak Soulemane is seeking to sue the state and West Haven for $10 million, claiming officials failed to properly train and supervise their officers.
Lawyers for the family filed a notice to the state claims commissioner Thursday, notifying the state of their intention to file a wrongful death lawsuit that seeks damages for the Jan. 15 shooting that killed Soulemane (www.courant.com).",Kenyatta Reynolds
